# Classify handwritten digits using the famous MNIST data

Training data consists of 60000 images of shape 28x28. Testing data contains 10000 images of shape 28x28. Datasets contains handwritten digits from 0-9. Dataset is taken from [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html). Model achieves 98.91%-99.11% accuracy with loss of 0.0284 on test data. Model loss graph can be seen as follow, training and testing loss is plotted againts epochs in the ![graph](model_loss.png).

Project 1 - Identify nerve structures in ultrasound images of the neck - Kaggle Competition
In this project, nurve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images of the neck were correctly
identified to effectively insert a patientâ€™s pain management catheter. Convolution Neural nertwork
is implemented in Keras.
